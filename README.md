# TerminalTweet

Allows the user to fetch tweets from the RSS feed of multiple Twitter profiles and displays them in a table format in the terminal. 

WHy did I create this?

I wanted to read tweets without opening the twitter app, right from my terminal (Terminal Maxis). 

Requirements:
-> Python 3.6+
-> feedparser library 
-> httpx library
-> rich library 

How to use:
--> Install the required libraries using the command below:
             pip install feedparser httpx rich
             
--> Clone or download the fetch_tweets.py script

--> Navigate in terminal to directory containing fetch_tweets.py script

--> Run the script using:
             python fetch_tweets.py 
             
--> Follow prompts to refresh, add usernames to display their tweets etc.

ENJOY! Make sure to suggest changes or features you want to be included if any!!
